A simple tool for generating beautiful documentation for C++.

Built for projects that use CMake and host their docs on GitHub Pages.

### Why?

Because I tried Doxygen for five seconds and found its output way too bloated and way too ugly.

The goals of this project is to generate documentation that looks beautiful and is super easy to navigate. I also wanted to make just browsing the docs intuitive and simple to encourage learning about what tools are available before you find an usecase for them.
